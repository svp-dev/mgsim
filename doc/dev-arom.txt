Active ROM
==========

The Active ROM is a combination of a (passive) ROM and an (active) DMA
controller. It supports both explicit reads to the ROM's contents
and DMA requests to push the ROM contents to the MG's memory.

The device presents itself to the I/O bus as a single device.

Note: the effect of changing the DCA configuration *during* a DCA
transfer are undefined.
