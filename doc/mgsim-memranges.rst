DESCRIPTION
===========

The following table provides a high-level overview of the memory address space,
as seen from the perspective of software running on the MGSim platform.

Addresses are given in hexadecimal and sizes in decimal.  The column
"Mode" indicates read (R) or write (W) capabilities. The column "A/C"
indicates whether the range address is an architectural constant (A)
or configurable per platform instance (C) [1]_.

NOTES
=====

.. [1] The difference between architectural constants and
   configurable parameters is that the program code must be recompiled
   when architectural constants change, whereas the same program binary
   should be portable to multiple platforms with different configurable
   parameter values.

.. [2] The ``argv[]`` and MGSim configuration data is *primarily*
   available as two ActiveROM devices (``rom_argv`` and
   ``rom_config``, cf. mgsimdev-arom(7), content sources ``ARGV`` and
   ``CONFIG``.). They are thus primarily reachable using regular
   memory-mapped I/O via the I/O device access ranges
   (0x70000000..0x7FFFFFFF), on cores where I/O is reachable.

   As a *secondary* mechanism, these two devices are pre-configured so
   that a DCA transfer will copy their contents in *main memory* in
   the address range 0x6FFF0000..6FFFFF00. This mechanism is provided
   for convenience, so that a lightweight test program can access this
   data without the overhead of DCA configuration, by simply defining
   ``PreloadROMtoRAM`` for these two devices.

.. [3] The memory-mapped I/O notification channels and device access
   mechanisms are only available on cores with ``EnableIO`` defined to
   ``true``. As of MGSim 3.3, only core 0 has this enabled by default.
