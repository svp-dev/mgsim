 Release notes for the Microgrid simulator
===========================================

This document describes major updates to the Microgrid simulator.

Major "technology levels" that reflect generations of the Microgrid
architecture (as simulated by this simulator) are documented
separately in CSA note [svp40].

Version 3.1 (Development)
=========================

New features
------------

- Allow to connect cores to I/O devices. See CSA note [mgsim14] for
  details of the architecture; see the subdirectory ``doc`` of the
  simulator sources for details about simulated devices.

- Allow to specify a strategy for creating families, including
  automatic load balancing. See CSA note [mgsim12] for details.

Changes since version 3.1
-------------------------

- A new configuration format was implemented to allow configuring
  individual components. See CSA notes [mgsim16] and [mgsim17] for
  details.

- Various simulated hardware buffers were (unrealistically)
  unbounded. Bounds have been set for nearly all buffers. For now the
  family allocation queues are still unbounded, waiting for proper
  priority handling of suspending vs. non-suspending requests on the
  delegation network.

Version 3.0, March 2011
=======================

New features
------------

- Implements the "break" instruction to stop creating new threads in a
  family.

- Allow to monitor the simulation asynchronously during execution. See
  CSA note [mgsim9] for details.

Changes since version 2.0
-------------------------

- The architecture is modified to use a linear chain to link cores
  instead of multiple cluster rings.

- Jointly, the addressing scheme for delegations is modified: a place
  identifier now both identifies the target core and the size of the
  cluster for the created family. See CSA note [mgsim11] for details.

Version 2.0, April 2010
=======================

New features
------------

- Allow programs to introspect performance counters. See CSA note [sl8].

- Integrate the COMA memory simulation from Li Zhang.

Changes since version 1.0
-------------------------

- The simulation is now event-driven: cycles which do not have
  activity are skipped.

- The ISA is changed to avoid sharing registers between parent thread
  and child family.

Version 1.0, June 2009
======================

- Simulate multiple cores and configurable memory systems. Features:

  - dynamic family configuration in the ISA.

  - choice between MT-Alpha and MT-SPARC ISAs.

  - thread-local storage using address space partitioning.

  - shared FPU pipelnes between multiple cores.
