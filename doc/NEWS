 Release notes for MGSim
=========================

This document describes major updates to MGSim.

Version 3.3 (Development)
=========================

New features
------------

- Preliminary support for the 32-bit MIPS  ISA.

- The configuration file supports sections; for example the following
  syntax::

     [CPU1]
     ICache:Associativity = 4
     DCache:Associativity = 8

  is equivalent to::

     CPU1.ICache:Associativity = 4
     CPU1.DCache:Associativity = 8

  The special section name ``[global]`` resets the
  prefix to empty.

- Configuration values can indirect through another configuration
  variable. For example::

     FPU_AddSubLatency = 3
     FPU*:Unit0Latency = $FPU_AddSubLatency
     FPU*:Unit1Latency = $FPU_AddSubLatency

Changes since version 3.2
-------------------------

- MGSim now uses C++11 features and requires a C++11 compliant
  compiler. GNU C++ 4.7 and 4.8 are reported to work, so are Clang 3.1
  to 3.3.

- a memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) interface supersedes the special "print"
  instruction in MGSim's Processor model.

- The unit test suite was refactored to better support parallel build
  and skip irrelevant tests.

- Fix several bugs in the SPARC ISA implementation.

Version 3.2
===========

New features
------------

- New infrastructure to estimate the silicon area cost of
  components using the 3rd-party package CACTI. 

- New memory system "DirectDDR" where cores/L1 caches
  are directly connected to DDR channels.

- New memory system "FlatCOMA" where L2 caches and DDR channels are
  connected in a single ring.

Changes since version 3.1
-------------------------

- Fix a bug in the DDR simulation code, which caused DDR accesses to
  appear sequential (instead of pipelined), resulting in sub-optimal
  simulation performance.

- Improved the reporting of cache access statistics.

Version 3.1, May 2011
=====================

New features
------------

- Allow to connect cores to I/O devices. See CSA note [mgsim14] for
  details of the architecture; see the subdirectory ``doc`` of the
  simulator sources for details about simulated devices.

- Allow to specify a strategy for creating families, including
  automatic load balancing. See CSA note [mgsim12] for details.

Changes since version 3.0
-------------------------

- A new configuration format was implemented to allow configuring
  individual components. See CSA notes [mgsim16] and [mgsim17] for
  details.

- Various simulated hardware buffers were (unrealistically)
  unbounded. Bounds have been set for nearly all buffers. For now the
  family allocation queues are still unbounded, waiting for proper
  priority handling of suspending vs. non-suspending requests on the
  delegation network.

Version 3.0, March 2011
=======================

New features
------------

- Implements the "break" instruction to stop creating new threads in a
  family.

- Allow to monitor the simulation asynchronously during execution. See
  CSA note [mgsim9] for details.

Changes since version 2.0
-------------------------

- The architecture is modified to use a linear chain to link cores
  instead of multiple cluster rings.

- Jointly, the addressing scheme for delegations is modified: a place
  identifier now both identifies the target core and the size of the
  cluster for the created family. See CSA note [mgsim11] for details.

Version 2.0, April 2010
=======================

New features
------------

- Allow programs to introspect performance counters. See CSA note [sl8].

- Integrate the COMA memory simulation from Li Zhang.

Changes since version 1.0
-------------------------

- The simulation is now event-driven: cycles which do not have
  activity are skipped.

- The ISA is changed to avoid sharing registers between parent thread
  and child family.

Version 1.0, June 2009
======================

- Simulate multiple cores and configurable memory systems. Features:

  - dynamic family configuration in the ISA.

  - choice between MT-Alpha and MT-SPARC ISAs.

  - thread-local storage using address space partitioning.

  - shared FPU pipelnes between multiple cores.
