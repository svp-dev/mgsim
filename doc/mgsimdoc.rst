DESCRIPTION
===========

The MGSim simulator was developed to facilitate research in the design
of many-core general-purpose processor chips, in particular Microgrid
chips based on D-RISC. It also includes full-system capability, 
including a fully configurable I/O subsystem and memory interconnect.

OVERVIEW
========

An execution of the simulator entails the following steps:

1. the simulator parses configuration parameters from a configuration
   file (``-c``) and optional configuration overrides on the command
   line (``-o`` / ``-I``).

2. it creates the system's components (cores, FPUs, memories, etc)
   using the configuration. Input files, including program code, is
   loaded into ROM pseudo-devices.

3. it signals to the processor chip to boot.

4. it proceeds to run the simulation of all components, until either
   of the following happens:

   - the software running on the platform signals explicit termination;
   - a simulation error occurs;
   - the user interrupts the simulation.

5. Unless instructed otherwise with option ``-t``, the simulation then
   drops to an interactive prompt where the state of the system can be
   inspected.

COMPONENTS AND TOPOLOGY
=======================

The minimum components found in a MGSim configuration are:

- a core;
- a memory system;
- an I/O network with a bootable ROM and SMC device.

The number of cores, as well as the topology of the I/O and memory
systems between cores, is configurable.

Cores
-----

MGSim defines two core models, MT-Alpha and MT-SPARC. Both models are
based on the general D-RISC core design. D-RISC is an in-order,
single-issue pipelined, dataflow-scheduled, multithreaded RISC
core. MGSim's core model simulates D-RISC's pipeline, functional
units, L1 cache, and ancillary components in detail, down to the
interactions at every clock cycle. D-RISC also features
asynchronous FPUs, where one FPU can be shared between two or more
D-RISC cores.

Contrary to other simulator or ISA emulators which decouple component
model simulation from the functional behavior of ISA instructions,
MGSim's core implementation realistically decomposes instruction
execution in multiple pipeline stages with explicit data paths and
latch buffers. This enables accurate modeling of timing-dependent
behavior fo all instructions, including inter-core synchronization,
memory accesses and I/O operations.

Currently the choice of the core model is static (compile-time);
it is selected during source configuration using ``--target``. 

Memory
------

MGSim simulates a many-core chip connected to a shared memory. The
memory protocol, topology and interconnect are determined by the
run-time choice of a memory system. 

The following memory systems are supported:

``serial``
   A simple bus connecting all cores with a single memory
   interface.

``parallel``
   A multi-ported memory interface is connected to all cores using
   separate links. Requests from each port are handled concurrently.
   Consistency is resolved on request completion.

``banked``
   Multiple memory interfaces are connected to all cores using an
   Omega network. The mapping of address space ranges to memory
   interfaces is configurable, and defaults to round-robin on the
   lowest significant bits of the address.

``randombanked``
   Same as ``banked``, with a bit shuffling for the mapping of
   addresses to interfaces, to maximize load distribution.

``directddr``
   Similar to ``banked``, where the memory interface simulates
   a DDR channel that pipelines memory requests.

``randomddr``
   Similar to ``randombanked``, with DDR interfaces.

``flatcoma``
   Cores are connected to L2 caches, in turn connected to memory
   interfaces.  Memory interfaces implement DDR channels. The L2
   caches and memory interface are organized in a ring. Directories at
   each memory interface determine what data is currently present in
   cache, to optimize accesses. Each group of core sharing a L2 cache
   is connected using a bus. The protocol migrates cache lines at the
   L2 cache of last use.

``coma``
   Like ``flatcoma``, with two levels of rings. L2 caches are
   connected together in multiple rings each containing a middle-level
   directory. Middle-level directories are then connected in a single
   top-level ring also containing the memory interfaces.
  
``zlcoma``
   Like ``coma``, using an alternate, token-based but less realistic
   cache coherence protocol.

On-chip interconnect
--------------------

When multiple cores are configured, they are automatically connected
together using three on-chip networks: the memory network (for memory
loads and stores), the delegation network (for cross-chip work
distribution) and the link network (for local work distribution
between adjacent cores).

The memory network is determined by the selected memory system, as
described above. The cores are placed over the 2D grid surface using a
space-filling curve, so as to maximize locality in the memory network
at different core cluster sizes.

The link network is a one-dimensional, word-wide, short-latency
network connecting all cores in their natural index ordering.

The delegation network connects all cores; is intended to be
implemented as a narrow mesh, although its timing model attributes a
single latency for any pairwise communication.

The interconnect is not directly configurable; instead, it is derived
automatically from the selected memory system and number of cores.

It is possible to dump the interconnect topology as a Graphviz
directed graph using command-line option ``-T``.

I/O subsystem
--------------

The cores are connected to the simulation's environment using an I/O
subsystem featuring pseudo-device emulations. The number of I/O
buses, which pseudo-devices are connected to them and how
they are connected to cores on the simulated chip are all
configurable.

The choice of pseudo-device types includes:

- realistic serial UARTs (``uart``);
- realistic real time clocks (``rtc``);
- character matrix displays (``lcd``);
- ROMs with integrated DMA controller (``arom``);
- a graphical framebuffer (``gfx``);
- a syscall interface to the host's POSIX file handling (``rpc``);
- a System Management Controller (SMC) responsible for booting up the
  simulated platform's software (``smc``).

Some of these pseudo-devices have their own documentation, cf `SEE
ALSO`_ below for details. 

COMPONENTS AND NAMING
=====================

A Microgrid system is simulated as a *hierarchy* of connected
*components*, implemented as objects in C++. Conceptually independent
from the C++ class hierarchy, the component hierarchy reflects the
position of the components on chip. For example the allocation unit
("``alloc``") is a sub-component of a processor ("``cpu``").

Components represent circuits that implement both processes and
storage (state). Processes are either single cycle, or state machines
over multiple cycles. Processes can perform the following actions:

- update storage, either locally or remotely, optionally
  through an arbitrator if the state is shared between two or more
  processes.

- send a signal, which (re-)starts another process either locally or
  remotely. This can be done either via explicit process activation or
  implicitely by pushing data into a buffer with a listener (consumer)
  process.

A component is defined by its sub-parts, which can be either:

- passive storage;

- arbitrators, that regulate shared access to passive storage;

- active storages, which wake up a consumer process upon becoming
  non-empty and suspend a producer process upon becoming full;

- processes, which access both storages and arbitrators;

- sub-components.

Moreover, each component can define one or more *monitoring variables*
that reflect its internal state. When a variable is defined, it also
has a name relative to the component where it is defined.

Entity names
------------

Components and their sub-parts are identified by a *name*, relative to
their parent entity. Any entity can be thus identified globally using
its *fully qualified name* (FQN), which indicates its path in the
hierarchy. For example ``cpu4.pipeline.execute`` is the FQN of the
execute stage of the pipeline of the 5th simulated core on the system.

Entity names are used throughout the simulation environment: to
manipulate components in the interactive prompt, to set up
configuration, to report simulation messages, etc.

The name of an entity mat indicate its type:

- names starting with "``b_``" identify *buffers*, ie. FIFO queues of
  fixed-width entries and a statically configurable maximum
  size. These are active storages;

- names starting with "``f_``" identify *flags*, ie. single-bit active
  storages;

- names starting with "``p_``" identify *priority arbitrators*;

The FQN of an entity can further identify its type: 

- a component FQN is a concatenation of its path in the hierarchy with
  periods ("``.``");

- a process FQN or monitoring variable FQN is the concatenation of its
  component FQN and its name with a colon ("``:``").

The list of all entities can be obtained from a running instance of
the Microgrid simulator. From the interactive prompt, the commands
``show components``, ``show processes`` and ``show vars`` in
interactive mode (``-i``) can be used. Here is an example session::

CONFIGURATION SYSTEM AND VARIABLES
==================================

The simulated Microgrid can be configured via command-line parameters
and an architecture configuration file. 

The following can be configured:

- the *simulation environment* itself. For example, the name of the
  asynchronous monitoring output stream.

- *architectural constants* which have a pervasive effect. For
  example, the D-RISC control block size.

- the *system layout*. For example, the number of cores, as well as
  which I/O devices are connected to each I/O network or the number of
  DDR channels.

- *individual component parameters*. These can be configured with
  separate values for each component of a given type. For example, the
  associativity of the L1 D-cache can be configured separately for
  each core. Similarly, buffer (FIFO) maximum sizes can be configured
  individually.

- *shared component parameters* that cannot (yet) be configured per
  component. For example, the core frequency and the cache line width
  are shared across the system.

Each configurable item has a *name* which identifies it uniquely. 

For individual component parameters, the name is composed of the fully
qualified component name (FQN), followed by a colon and the parameter
name. For example, ``cpu27.dcache:associativity`` is the parameter
name for the associativity of the D-cache of core 27.

For all other configurable items, the option name is simply the name
of the item. For example, ``ControlBlockSize`` is the name of the
parameter to configure the control block size.

The set of all configurable items is documented in the reference
configuration file provided alongside ``mgsim``.

Configuration specification
---------------------------

The input configuration is a *sequence of configuration rules*
called the *configuration space*. Each configuration rule has the
form::

   pattern = value

The value of each parameter is determined by *first match* of the
parameter name against the sequence of patterns from the configuration
rules. Matching is performed using *case-insensitive* comparison
and Unix shell pattern matching semantics. In particular, ``*``
matches any string (including the empty string), ``?`` matches any
character, and ``[...]`` matches any one of the enclosed characters.

For example, given the following configuration space::

   cpu27.dcache:numsets = 8
   cpu*.dcache:numsets = 4

the parameter ``system.cpu27.dcache:numsets`` matches the first
specification and configures the D-cache of core 27 with 8 cache
sets. Meanwhile, the corresponding parameter for all other cores fall
back to the second specification and configure the remaining D-caches
with 4 cache sets.

The configuration space is constructed when the simulator is started,
using the following input:

1. any *override* from the command line (parameters ``-o`` and
   ``-I``), in inverse order: later overrides on the command line are
   considered first;

2. the contents of the *configuration file* specified with parameter
   ``-c``, or the default configuration file if none is specified, in
   inverse order: later key/value pairs in the file are considered
   first.

The configuration space can be dumped to the console output upon
initialization using the command-line parameter ``-d``. It is also copied
to the asynchronous monitoring metadata file if this is enabled.

Important configuration variables
---------------------------------

The following parameters seem to receive most interest:

``NumProcessors``
   The number of cores.

``CPU*.ICache:Associativity``, ``CPU*.ICache:NumSets``
   The size of individual L1 I-caches.

``CPU*.DCache:Associativity``, ``CPU*.DCache:NumSets``
   The size of individual L1 D-caches.

``MemoryType``
   The memory system to use.

``Memory:NumRootDirectories``
   For COMA-based systems, the number of root directories and thus
   number of external memory interfaces.

``NumClientsPerL2Cache``
   For COMA-based systems, the number of cores per L2 cache. Combined
   with ``NumProcessors`` this determines the number of L2 caches in
   total.

``Memory:L2CacheAssociativity``, ``Memory:L2CacheNumSets``
   The size of each L2 cache.

Default values
--------------

Configurable parameters are generally not assigned default values. The
simulator should report an error when no pattern in the configuration
space matches the name of a parameter that needs configuration.

There are exceptions to this rule. Some parameters do have default values,
which are described as comments in the reference configuration file.

Configuration file format
-------------------------

The files read by parameters ``-c`` and ``-I`` are text files that
contain configuration specifications of the form ``key = value``, as
described above.

In a configuration file, the following extra syntax is also recognized:

- comments starting with ``#`` or ``;`` at the start of lines or after
  values;

- "section names", of the form ``[NAME]``. A section name introduces a
  common prefix for the following keys, until the following section
  name. For example, the following syntax::

     [CPU1]
     ICache:Associativity = 4
     DCache:Associativity = 8

  is equivalent to::

     CPU1.ICache:Associativity = 4
     CPU1.DCache:Associativity = 8

  The special section name ``[global]`` resets the
  prefix to empty.


More examples can be found in the default configuration file shipped
with the program.

Standard configuration file
---------------------------

MGSim is shipped with a standard configuration file which defines the
following system as of August 2012:

- 128 D-RISC cores at 1GHz, with 2K+4K L1 caches;

- 64 FPUs (2 cores per FPU);

- ``randombanked`` memory system clocked at 1GHz;

- one I/O pseudo-device of each type, around an I/O network connected
  to the first core only. The first ROM contains the program image
  specified on the command line, if any. Additional devices with type
  ``arom`` are created to hold character strings for additional
  command-line arguments and the configuration space.

INTERACTIVE MODE
================

When started with ``-i``, or upon encountering an error and ``-t`` is
not specified, MGSim presents an interactive prompt to the user to 
control the simulation.

The prompt indicates the current simulation cycle.

The command ``help`` lists the available commands.

  Enable/Disable tracing of the cache line at address ADDR by memory COMPONENT.

``trace [FLAGS...]``
  Show current traces / toggle tracing of FLAGS.

MONITORING
==========

MGSim offers two mechanisms to monitor the simulated environment over
time: synchronous *event traces*, where all detailed events are
reported, and asynchronous *variable traces*, where the state
of the simulation is sampled at regular time intervals.

Synchronous event traces
------------------------

Event traces are enabled using the ``trace`` command in interactive
mode (``-i``). It causes MGSim to report events in a text format on
its standard output at each simulation step.

Event categories can be individually selected:

``trace regs``
    Events reporting updates to the cores' register files.

``trace pipe``
    Events reporting pipeline activity within cores.

``trace fpu``
    Events reporting FPU activity.

``trace mem``
    Events reporting memory loads and stores.

``trace io``
    Events reporting I/O operations.

``trace ionet``
    Events reporting communication on the I/O interconnect.

``trace net``
    Events reporting communication on the inter-core delegation and
    link networks.

``trace sim``
    Events about concurrency management and synchronization between
    cores.

``trace deadlocks``
    Events reporting process stalls.

``trace flow``
    Events reporting control flow of the software running on the
    platform (branches).

``trace prog``
    Debugging messages generated by the software running on the platform.

The special aliases ``trace all`` and ``trace none`` are also
recognized.

A full simulation trace can be generated using the following command::

    echo "trace all; run; quit" | mgsim -i ...  >event-trace.log

A simulation trace can in turn be transformed to an HTML table for
graphical representations with the separate ``viewlog`` utility. See
viewlog(1) for details.

Note that synchronous event traces slow down the simulation by a large
factor.

Asynchronous variable traces
----------------------------

Variable traces are enabled using the command-line flag ``-m``. It
causes MGSim to start a second thread in the simulation process which
samples monitoring variables at a regular time interval.

The list of monitoring variables to sample is selected using the
configuration variable ``MonitorSampleVariables``. The standard
selection shipped with the standard configuration file monitors the
number of instructions issued, and the number of floating-point
instructions executed over time. It can be overloaded using ``-o``.

The time interval between samples is configured using
``MonitorSampleDelay``; the standard configuration sets this to 1ms.

The asynchronous monitoring has two outputs. The *metadata* indicates
which variables were selected and their width in bytes. The *trace*
reports the samples in fixed-length data packets. The output file
names are configured using ``MonitorMetadataFile`` and
``MonitorTraceFile``, and default to ``mgtrace.md`` and
``mgtrace.out``.

The metadata and trace can then in turn be converted to text form
using the separate utility ``readtrace``; see readtrace(1) for details.

For example::

     mgsim -m -o MonitorSampleVariables="cpu*.pipeline.execute.op"
     readtrace mgtrace.md mgtrace.out >var-trace.log

Asynchronous monitoring automatically suspends whenever MGSim displays
its interactive prompt.
