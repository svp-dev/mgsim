         Threads can terminate out of index order. This leads to problems
         when figuring out which thread is the logical predecessor of the
         next created thread.
         For local creates, the family's lastAllocated field can be used
         to find the last allocated thread, which is always the predecessor
         of the next created thread. However, in group creates, threads must
         be linked up across cores. The family's firstInBlock field is
         used for this. However, if threads complete out of order,
         thise field can be overwritten with the next block's first
         thread, causing the border thread on the previous core to link
         up with the wrong thread.
         To counter this, sequential thread cleanup is enforced by introducing
         a dependency on the previous thread's cleanup event.
